# Minesweeper in C

This project is an implementation of the Minesweeper game in C, using the ncurses library for terminal-based user interface management.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you need:

- A C compiler (such as `gcc`)
- The `ncurses` library

### Installing ncurses

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

On Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install ncurses-devel
```

On macOS:

```bash
brew install ncurses
```

## Compilation

To compile the project, use the `make` command in the project directory:

```bash
make
```

This will generate an executable named `demineur` in the current directory.

## Execution

To run the game, use the following command after compiling the project:

```bash
./cmineur
```

## Cleaning Up

To remove the object files and directories generated by the compilation, use the `make clean` command:

```bash
make clean
```

This will delete the `.bin/` directory and all its contents.
